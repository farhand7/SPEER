- remove first underscore from all functions
- comment descriptions include at end of line 
- shift-command-p sort lines for list of packages
- option command line parse - include this as a set of options (opt-parse files)

network.py
	use similar notation to scikit learn approach
			create network class that decides parameters to run model
			.fit(data) to optimize parameters | data.

process.py
	- parent Process class
		- simulate class
		- gtex class
	- additional parameter (str object) = {'simulate', 'gtex'}
		- use conditional logic

	- dropna threshold
		- create dictionary mapping from tissue groups to # observed tissues per sample
			- have this as a parameter so it can be changed if needed


	- change name of tissue-specific train to "train_t" to differentiate better between train_list and train

	- minimize # of class variables (self)
		- if variable is not being used outside of initialize method, then no need to make it a class variable 



add a stats folder
	- include naive bayes and logistic regression to that folder

create a markdown file (README.md)
	- demonstrate how everything works - high level how to use everything and how the files connect



high level : blocked comment below each class definition describing what the class does
